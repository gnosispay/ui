# PSE backend demo

This is a reference implementation of a backend relaying a front-end request to `/token` to a mTLS authenticated `/ephemeral-token` of the Gnosis Pay PSE service. The ephemeral-token is then returned back.

More info [in the Partner Secure Elements guide](https://docs.gnosispay.com/pse-integration).

This server exposes the following routes:
- `/token` to relay an ephemeral-token request
- `/health-check` to verify the liveness of the sever
